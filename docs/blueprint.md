## Core Features:

- Visual Tree: Display a multi-root hierarchical tree or network, with zoom/pan/collapse.
- Node Editor: Enable markdown editing of node content, support edit history
- Import / Export: Data serialization using JSON, and support importing / exporting the content to files.
- Plan Decomposition: Decompose a selected plan node in the tree to smaller, implementable sub plans with an LLM tool.

- Secondary color: Use a light gray (#f0f0f0) for panels and input areas.
- Accent: Use a vibrant green (#2ecc71) for active elements and to show positive execution status.
- Clear and consistent typography for the plan text, consider using a monospace font.
- Use simple and clear icons for actions (edit, save, execute).
- A clean, intuitive layout for the tree view and node editor.
- Smooth transitions and animations for node expansion/collapse.
