// This page is effectively replaced by src/app/(app)/page.tsx
// For a production app, you might have a landing page here or redirect to /app.
// For now, let's make it render the main app page for simplicity, though typically this would be in a route group.
// To keep it simple and avoid needing to move the main app to `/app` route, we'll just use the new (app)/page.tsx directly.
// This file can be minimal or could redirect.
// Given the current structure with (app) group, Next.js should route / to (app)/page.tsx if that's the only page.
// If not, we make this file a simple pass-through or a redirect component.

// The prompt implies the default page should be the app.
// With App Router, if you have `(app)/page.tsx`, and no other `/page.tsx` at the root,
// `/` might automatically serve `(app)/page.tsx`. Let's assume this behavior.
// If not, this root `page.tsx` should ideally redirect to the main app page.
// For now, we'll keep it empty as (app)/page.tsx should be the primary entry.

// However, to ensure / works, this page should render the main content or redirect.
// The (app) group is for layout, not path. So (app)/page.tsx IS the root page.
// No changes needed here if (app)/page.tsx is the intended root.
// Let's make sure it correctly loads (app)/page.tsx.

// The instruction "Default to Next.js App Router for improved performance with nested layouts and route groups"
// and "Avoid using route groups and use simple routing for authenticated navigation."
// Route groups for layout like (app) are fine.

// Current page.tsx in user's files is empty.
// The main application is now in (app)/page.tsx.
// This root page.tsx should be effectively replaced or delegate.
// Let's delete this file and let (app)/page.tsx serve as the root.
// Alternatively, if there must be a src/app/page.tsx, it should import and render the contents of (app)/page.tsx
